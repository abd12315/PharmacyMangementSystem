üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Visual Studio: Version 2019 or later (Community, Professional, or Enterprise). Download Visual Studio.

.NET Framework: The project targets a specific .NET Framework version (e.g., 4.7.2 or 4.8). Ensure you have the necessary developer packs installed with Visual Studio.

SQL Server (or LocalDB): The application likely uses SQL Server for database management.

If using SQL Server Express or a full SQL Server instance, ensure it's installed and accessible.

If using LocalDB (often installed with Visual Studio), no extra setup might be needed beyond ensuring the connection string is correct.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/abd12315/PharmacyMangementSystem.git

Navigate into the project directory:

cd PharmacyMangementSystem/WindowsFormsApp1/Pharmacy Management

Open in Visual Studio:

Locate the .sln (solution) file (e.g., Pharmacy Management.sln) within the cloned directory.

Double-click the .sln file to open the project in Visual Studio.

Restore NuGet Packages:

Visual Studio should automatically prompt you to restore any missing NuGet packages. If not, right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages."

Database Setup (Important!):

Review the App.config or Web.config file (or connectionString in code) for database connection details. You will need to ensure your local SQL Server instance name and database name match what's expected by the application.

If a database script (.sql file) is provided in the repository, execute it on your SQL Server instance to create the necessary tables and populate initial data.

Example Connection String (check your project for the actual one):

<connectionStrings>
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=YourSqlServerInstanceName;Initial Catalog=PharmacyDB;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>

Replace YourSqlServerInstanceName with your actual SQL Server instance name (e.g., (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB or .\SQLEXPRESS).

Running the Application

Once the project is loaded in Visual Studio and the database is set up, press F5 or click the "Start" button in Visual Studio to build and run the application.
